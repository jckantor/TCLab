    "The `tclab` package provides a set of Python tools for interfacing with the [BYU Temperature Control Laboratory](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl). The Temperature Control Laboratory consists of two heaters and two temperature sensors mounted on an Arduino microcontroller board. Together, the `tclab` package and the Temperature Control Laboratory provide a low-cost experimental platform for implementing algorithms commonly used for process control.\n",
